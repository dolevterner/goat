    <p>Goats are a four legged mammal, they feed their offsprings with their own self brewed milk. </br> Goats are beautiful loyal animals whom love their owners and will forever be in their disposal. </p>
    <p>Growing up in the kibbutz I myself had two goats whom I was resposible for, one was Tchelet and the second was Dolev.</br></br> Tchelet was a beautiful white goat who's mother had disowned her and would not take care of her, for this reason i was put in charge of her. I would feed her daily with a milk bottle and it felt as if she was my own daughter. Tchelet would recognize me and follow me around the zoo. She was friendly with all humans and was very kind goat.</p>
    <p>Dolev was a male goat, he too was disowned by his mother and I was put in charge of him. Dolev was a powerful and beautiful goat. He was taken to many TV shows and was sold for good money. Every male alpha goat that was brought to the Zoo would be called, Dolev after my own beautiful little goat.</p>
